Your task involves developing a user-friendly software application that effectively retrieves, stores, and displays current and historical stock price data. The software should interface with a chosen database to persistently store stock price histories. Additionally, it should allow users to select specific stocks they wish to monitor closely.

Key features to include in the software:

API Integration: Utilize APIs (e.g., financial data providers like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.) to retrieve real-time and historical stock price data. Database Implementation: Employ a robust database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) to efficiently store and manage the collected stock price data. User Interaction: Develop an intuitive user interface allowing users to input and track their chosen stocks. Implement functionalities to add, remove, or modify the list of monitored stocks. Watching Algorithm: Create an algorithm that continuously monitors selected stocks and alerts users when a stock's price drops below a predefined threshold (e.g., 10% of its original price). Notifications can be through in-app alerts, email, or any preferred communication method. Data Visualization: Implement graphical representations (graphs, charts) to illustrate the stock price trends over time for the selected stocks. Reliability and Efficiency: Ensure the application's reliability in fetching and updating stock data promptly. Optimize database queries and API requests to enhance performance. Security Measures: Implement necessary security measures to protect sensitive user data, especially when storing API keys or personal information.

Remember, the aim is to showcase your proficiency in API integration, database management, algorithmic logic, user interface design, and system reliability.
